created this framework for building webservices.

i got sidetracked while writing some other code. ended up spending time on this
wrapper around rack to easily create webservices that can respond to
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD via JSON and/or XML REST calls.

see a working example @ http://bit.ly/3Cn0Ev (inactive -- ec2 costs were
prohibitive)

to run:
ln -sf development.ru config.ru
./start.sh
